# QuantCoder (Legacy CLI Version)

QuantCoder is a command-line tool that allows users to generate QuantConnect trading algorithms from research articles using natural language processing and large language models (LLMs). It was initiated in November 2023 and based on a cognitive architecture inspired by the article ["Dual Agent Chatbots and Expert Systems Design"](https://towardsdev.com/dual-agent-chatbots-and-expert-systems-design-25e2cba434e9)

The initial version successfully coded a blended momentum and mean-reversion strategy as described in ["Outperforming the Market (1000% in 10 years)"](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-outperform-the-market-fe151b944c77?sk=7066045abe12d5cf88c7edc80ec2679c), which received over 10,000 impressions on LinkedIn.

As of November 2025, it is under refactoring with readiness expected in February 2026.

🧠 LLM Configuration
By default, this project uses the OpenAI gpt-4o-2024-11-20 model for generating trading code from research articles.

## 💡 Usage

To launch the CLI tool in interactive mode:

```bash
python -m quantcli.cli interactive
```

Or if `quantcli` is recognized as a command:

```bash
quantcli interactive
```

## ⚠️ OpenAI SDK Compatibility

This legacy version uses the **OpenAI SDK v0.28**. Newer versions (`>=1.0.0`) are **not supported**.

If you encounter this error:

```
You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported...
```

Fix it by running:

```bash
pip install openai==0.28
```
